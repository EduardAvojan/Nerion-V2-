# Understanding the Core Components

This tutorial will help you understand the core components of the Nerion V2 agent.

## The Brain of the Agent

The core of the Nerion V2 agent is a set of components that work together to provide a seamless and intelligent user experience. These components are like the different parts of a brain, each with its own specific function.

## The Dialog Manager: The Conversation Keeper

The Dialog Manager is like the agent's short-term memory. It keeps track of the conversation history, the current context, and what the user is trying to do. This allows the agent to have a natural and flowing conversation with the user.

## The Intent Router: The Mind Reader

The Intent Router is like the agent's intuition. It tries to understand what the user wants, even if they don't say it directly. It does this by analyzing the user's words and matching them to a list of known intents.

## The Planner: The Problem Solver

The Planner is like the agent's strategic thinking. When the user asks the agent to do something complex, the Planner breaks the task down into a series of smaller, more manageable steps. This allows the agent to tackle complex problems without getting overwhelmed.

## The Tooling: The Hands of the Agent

The Tooling is like the agent's hands. It gives the agent the ability to interact with the outside world. The agent can use its tools to read and write files, run commands, and even browse the web.

By understanding these core components, you can get a better sense of how the Nerion V2 agent works and how you can customize it to meet your specific needs.

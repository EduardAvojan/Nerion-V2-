# Your First Nerion Agent

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a simple "Hello, World!" agent with Nerion V2.

## 1. Create a new Python file

Create a new Python file named `my_agent.py` and add the following code:

```python
from app.nerion_chat import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 2. Run the agent

To run the agent, use the following command:

```bash
python my_agent.py
```

This will start the Nerion V2 chat interface. You can now interact with your agent by typing messages in the console.

## 3. Customize the agent

To customize the agent, you can modify the `my_agent.py` file. For example, you can change the agent's name, the greeting message, or the commands that it responds to.

For more information on how to customize your agent, please refer to the [Customizing Your Agent](./customizing-agent.md) tutorial.

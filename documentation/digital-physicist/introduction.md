# Introduction

The Digital Physicist is Nerion V2's deep-thinking GNN engine. It is responsible for handling complex and novel problems that require a deep understanding of the codebase.

The Digital Physicist is not just a passive component; it is an active learner that constantly seeks to improve its understanding of the codebase. It does this by generating its own curriculum, running experiments, and learning from the outcomes.

This allows the Digital Physicist to master the complex "physics" of the codebase and to provide insights and solutions that would be difficult or impossible for a human to find.
